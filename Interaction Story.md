Fixing the DMCA:

Starting a Project:

Aaron is steaming mad about the DMCA preventing him from hacking his own iPad. So he goes out and looks for the DMCA to try to fix it. He has heard about Fork the Law, so comes to visit our site to work on it. He logs in with mozilla Persona and is prompted to enter more information about himself, but he quickly dismisses that because he’s so steaming mad he wants to get started.

He selects “create a new project” from the next menu instead of “join a specific project”, “find a project to work on”. The next menu prompts him to enter the area of code he wants to work on. He has the option of selecting a section by number. He doesn’t know the number, so he’s walked through a series of questions.

The first question is a dropdown with a long list of descriptions, described as Titles. He also has the option to drop to a straight search here, but since he can see Title 17, copyrights he skips that.

Next, it comes up with all these chapters. He can’t figure out what chapter the DMCA is in, so he goes to the search box and enters “Digital Millennium Copyright Act”. He gets 47 code sections in return, none of which are labeled “Digital Millennium Copyright Act.” He clicks a looking glass next to the first to see what it says. The first deals with something having to do with material online. Interesting, but not what he was looking for. On the second view he got lucky. He clicked on 17 USC § 1201 is all about anti-circumvention.

So he closes the little view window and selects that section of code. A few interesting things happen before he enters his own workspace. First, he is prompted for a project name. He hesitates, but the prompt informs him that he can change the name if it grows. He names his project “Tablet Freedom”. Next he is alerted that other people are working on this section, and given an opportunity to view their project. 

He has a look at the description of the first project and sees that they are interested in freeing game consoles. Good work, but not what Aaron is really concerned about. He quickly flags this project as “similar” and goes on to the next. That one involves a group of inventors who believe their robots should enjoy more protection. Since Aaron is interested in reducing restrictions rather than increasing them, he flags that one “opposed”. The third appears to be a bunch of nutjobs who are thinking about how alien technology might be licensed. He marks that “unrelated”.

Working on a Project:

With that done, Aaron’s new project comes up. A window comes up with many suggestions that he has options to address. There are several hundred court cases and many Federal Register publications and even a dozen law journal articles in separate tabs. He chooses not to deal with those just yet and goes straight to the text of the statute to edit. He stares at it for a bit, reading and rereading it, realizing he doesn’t know how to fix it for tablets, since none of what he knows about the law is addressed in the statute.

But it does say something about the Librarian of Congress and Register of Copyrights making decisions. Aaron is kind of stuck, so he clicks on some help topics. He browses through help pages to find out how to figure out what’s going on with the LoC and Register of Copyrights. Through the help pages, he realizes that those Federal Register publications are probably important here. He bounces back to that screen to address all those suggestions that came up.

Bringing in contributors:

Aaron realizes that there’s way too much information there that he needs to sift through. He gets a few friends who he was talking about this with to make their own accounts to help out.

When Brian and Chris log in, they create new accounts by importing their facebook profiles. They figure if they’re going to spend time working on this, then all their friends better know how cool they are for helping Aaron out. The account creation comes up with a screen that authorizes the facebook app, then the next screen gives them the ability to select information to import as well as authorization to make posts to their walls. Brian doesn’t post much and thinks the posts are a great idea, but Chris thinks it’s probably going to be spam, so doesn’t enable that feature.

Once their profiles are enabled, they move on to the next screen where they are prompted about starting, joining or finding a project. They select “Join a Specific Project” then type in “Tablet Freedom” in the name search box. Only one project has that title and it has Aaron’s name next to it, so they know it’s the right one. They get a notification that their membership in the project is pending, so they bug Aaron to let him know they’re ready to go.

Project contributor administration

Aaron is a little annoyed at this, as the system has already emailed him with their pending application. But he’s been paging through the Federal Register documents trying to make heads or tails of what he’s looking at. He clicks on the project management link and sees the pending requests. He approves his good friend Brian as a full administrator, but Chris is kind of obnoxious so he only approves him for full edits. Other options include “synopses,” “comments” or “promotional materials”. That seems kind of weird at this point, but might come in handy once they got this law ready to go. He also sees the option further down that he can request help in interesting categories. “Legalese” seems like something that’d be fantastic to get help in. Aaron is not ready to request help in other areas like “promotional writing” or even “general help”. 

Aaron closes the admin window and returns to the project space. Off to one side, there is now a box with the account names of the contributors. When Aaron saw the pics of his friends that show up on the project next to their names, he decides he also wants to get his thumbnail up there. He switches back to his profile page where he has the ability to link to his facebook account. But being a privacy nerd, he decides he doesn’t want to link and just uploads a pic and fills in a little more personal information.

Aaron, Brian and Chris divide up the register articles amongst themselves to read. Each are able to attach their own name/profile to each one to let the others know they are working on it.

Additional contributors

After spinning their wheels for a day or so, Aaron gets an email message that  there are volunteers who have requested to join the project: two names he doesn’t know. He clicks on each of the profiles in turn. The first, Zelda, has her linkedIn profile attached. She’s apparently a second year law student who has responded to his request for help with the “legalese”. Her LinkedIn profile says she’s done some work at the Public Defender’s office, but not much else since high school. He decides that he should approve her for “synopses” since the description for that sounds like the legalese translation work he really needs.

The second name, Yanni on the list doesn’t have any more information. He has no idea who this person is. They may be helpful or not, but he has no idea. He sends them a message asking for more information about their skills and why they want to help. He also bashfully realizes that he has provided little information on himself. He liked Zelda’s LinkedIn profile since it made her seem serious and professional (a bit unlike his friends who linked their Facebook accounts) so he decides to link his profile so people understood better that they were dealing with a serious guy who would get this thing through.

Adding articles

Zelda is online so she immediately shows up in the project chat to say “hi”. She seems really cheerful and energetic. She starts off by immediately recommending some EFF articles on the subject of tablet unlocking, which link to the latest decision by the Library of Congress. When she recommends that decision, instead of making an external link, it pulls up the previously recommended Federal Register record where the decision was officially published. She then enters a brief explanation of what the record says and picks out the decision where the tablets were explicitly excluded. Because this references the statute that the court used to make that decision, the statute is also added to the workspace.

Contributor interaction

In the mean time, Aaron and Zelda are chatting in the project chat window. Aaron has a lot of questions. Zelda answers some and defers others. Some of the answers seem so awesome that Aaron pins her explanations to the project workspace as general comments.
