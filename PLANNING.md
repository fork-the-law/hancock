## Problems
The following is a list of items that we've identified as issues that could be resolved or reduced by completing items listed in the `Goals` section.

  1. Congress doesn't know who the `subject matter experts` are for a given subject.
  1. `Subject matter experts` are not involved in legislation that affects their subject.
  1. Legislation is informed by financial/special interests instead of `subject of matter experts`.
  1. The `subject matter experts` that Congress does know about cannot be easily vetted as experts in their subject.
  1. Impetus for legislation informed by financial/special interests is frequently exaggerated by `manufactured outrage`.
  1. It is difficult for people outside the legal/legislative field to understand the law well enough to participate in drafting legislation.

## Goals
The goals listed in this section aim to resolve or reduce the items listed in the `Problems` section.

  1. `Subject matter experts` should be able to inform legislative drafting.
  1. Legal researchers should be able to provide legal `summaries` to `project contributors`.
  1. Legislative drafts should present an opportunity for thoughtful discussion on the subject matter.
  1. `Drafters` should be able to garner support for their `legislative drafts` from `subject matter experts`.
  1. Contributors should be exposed to other projects relating to their subject matter for comparison and/or collaboration.
