Functional areas of the application can be broken down as follows

# User management
This is the part where we organize the user objects and all the things they can do.

## New user
Create a new user profile. Should be able to pull data from all the social networks. (Make the hurdle of joining easier.)
### New user guidance
Having hints and tips on how users can get the most out of this would really facilitate adoption.

## Profile update
Add fanciness to the profile. Connect to other social networks. Only 1 pic at a time, though, please.

## Delete user
Simple module to make sure everything is gone when they want it gone. Some discussion here about deleting all contributions.

## Search for project
To join, you must find. If no project found, go to workspace management and get started. 95% of users will likely join someone else's project, so this is important.

## Participate in project
This is a nebulous area that's definitely a work in progress. To make this meaningful, they must participate. 

### Follow
For all the lurkers in the world, let them have a news feed. (See promotion stuff below.) It'd be awesome for people to be able to get updates from multiple projects. This needs a bit of fleshing out since we really don't want to facilitate spectating.

### Endorse
The most basic level of participation, a user should be able to attach their name in support of a project. This should enable them to access promotional materials the project puts together for supporters.

### Fork
Copy someone else's work and make it your own! All the usual options apply here, only since the data for all the workspaces should be structured the same, there should be fixed, limited options for forking and merging into alternate workspaces might be a possibility. That's the advanced course, I think.

### Pull request
This is perhaps one of the more important parts of this project. Totally independent projects should be able to get merged. Islands of associated thought should be able to bridge the straights between them.

### Ask to join
Joining a project would allow the user to become a contributor. User management and roll assignments within the project should be dealt with by the project curator.


# Workspace management
These are related to user management issues and possibly should be folded into that area. 

## Create workspace
This is a more complex process than it sounds. The user would need to have a robust search (similar to the user search above) but it must get narrowed down to a single 'code section'. Probably

## Link workspace
This is a possible advanced function: For acts that span multiple code sections, where multiple, linked changes are sought, it would make sense to have multiple workspaces linked in a code section. Or possibly multiple code sections in a workspace. That would make pull requests from alternate origins a bit more difficult.

## Grant permissions
The 'curator' should have the ability to grant permissions to users, add and remove permissions on all objects in his workspace. Something should show who is responsible for what.

# Legislative editor
The 'legislative draft' 'editor' should be a multi-user editing environment (not necessarily simultaneously), where individual users' granted 'drafter' rights contributions are tracked. It should include annotation ability that enables discussions as well as linking summary and opinion documents that have been identified as relevant to a specific section of text.

Anchors to documents should remain attached to the text of the draft even if the section of text it was attached to has been deleted. 

# Summaries and opinions

## Browsing
'' should be able to leaf through the cases attached to the document and add or remove relevant cases. 'Contributors', 'legal researchers' and 'drafters' should be able to leaf through summaries and attach them to the 'legislative draft'.

## Editing
'Legal researchers' 

## Auto-populating
Advanced functionality may include cases and other documents automatically suggested for inclusion in the project.

# Promotion management
All the activities that are related to pushing this change through Congress are encompassed in this area.
