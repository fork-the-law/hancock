Functional areas of the application can be broken down as follows

# User management
This is the part where we organize the user objects and all the things they can do.

## New user
Create a new user profile. Should be able to pull data from all the social networks. (Make the hurdle of joining easier.)
### New user guidance
Having hints and tips on how users can get the most out of this would really facilitate adoption.

## Profile update
Add fanciness to the profile. Connect to other social networks. Only 1 pic at a time, though, please.

## Delete user
Simple module to make sure everything is gone when they want it gone. Some discussion here about deleting all contributions.

## Search for project
To join, you must find. If no project found, go to workspace management and get started. 95% of users will likely join someone else's project, so this is important.

## Participate in project
This is a nebulous area that's definitely a work in progress. To make this meaningful, they must participate. 

### Follow
For all the lurkers in the world, let them have a news feed. (See promotion stuff below.) It'd be awesome for people to be able to get updates from multiple projects. This needs a bit of fleshing out since we really don't want to facilitate spectating.

### Endorse
The most basic level of participation, a user should be able to attach their name in support of a project. This should enable them to access promotional materials the project puts together for supporters.

### Fork
Copy someone else's work and make it your own! All the usual options apply here, only since the data for all the workspaces should be structured the same, there should be fixed, limited options for forking and merging into alternate workspaces might be a possibility. That's the advanced course, I think.

### Pull request
This is perhaps one of the more important parts of this project. Totally independent projects should be able to get merged. Islands of associated thought should be able to bridge the straights between them.

### Ask to join
Joining a project would allow the user to become a contributor
